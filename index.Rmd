The purpose of the application is to interactively explore aspects of the k-means clustering, unsupervised learning algorithm in a wine "tasting" scenario. It runs the algorithm on a dataset of 13 chemicals analysed from 177 wine samples, cultivated in Italy by 3 different growers.

* The application provides an interactive slider to set the number of k-means clusters.
* The results are immediately displayed in a scatterplot with the set number of clusters.
* A two dimensional plot is achieved by linear dimension reduction using discrproj (R package fpc).

* The actual grower for each wine sample can be revealed for comparison with the k-means clusters.

## <p style="color:darkred;font-size:48px;">Growers and Silhouette</p>


* In the screen shot of the application shown below, the clusters do indeed allocate wines quite well to growers, although the blue cluster looks doubtful.
* The Machine Wine "Tasting" k-means clustering application uses Silhouette
* Silhouette is a method of interpretation and validation of consistency within clusters of data
* The average Silhouette width over all data of the entire dataset is one kind of measure of how appropriately the data has been clustered. The greater the width the better.
* The Machine Wine "Tasting" application indicates average Silhouette values by a red band, as in the figure.

## <p style="color:darkred;font-size:48px;">The "Lost" Plot</p>
*** =left
* Although the application shows average Silhouette width it doesn't provide a Silhouette plot. 
* A Silhouette plot has been generated here, based on 4 k-means clusters.
* From the previous scatterplot it is perhaps not surprising that one of the clusters has a negative width, indicative of a poor fit.
* In the next version of the application we plan to show Silhouette plots
* The application can be found at: https://ronsegal.shinyapps.io/mlwines
